# PDBFixer Manual of Usage

PDBFixer repairs and prepares Protein Data Bank (PDB/PDBx) files for downstream simulation. This manual summarizes the most common workflows, links to installation instructions, and provides troubleshooting tips for working with the Neoralab-maintained fork.

Use the navigation to jump directly to install, configuration, reference, and examples. For the legacy single-page manual shipped in the upstream repository, open [`Manual.html`](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/openmm/pdbfixer/blob/master/Manual.html).
